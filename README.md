# Spring Boot Day 2 – REST API

This project is part of my daily learning journey to become a Spring Boot expert and full-stack developer.

## 🔧 What This Project Does

- Creates a simple REST API using Spring Boot
- Supports `GET` and `POST` operations
- Handles a custom `Note` entity (with title and content)

## 🧪 Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint       | Description             |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|
| GET    | /api/notes     | Returns all notes       |
| POST   | /api/notes     | Adds a new note (JSON)  |

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Web
- Maven

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run

api endpoint:http://localhost:8080/api/notes

Sample output
[
{
"name": "Santhosh",
"subject": "Maths"
},
{
"name": "mani",
"subject": "Physics"
}
]
```
## 📅 Day 3 – Spring Boot: Layered Architecture (Service + Repository)

### ✅ What I Did
- Refactored my Notes app to follow the **three-layer architecture**:
    - **Controller Layer** – Handles HTTP requests
    - **Service Layer** – Contains business logic
    - **Repository Layer** – Interacts with the database using JPA
- Used my **Docker-based local SQL database** for data persistence
- Tested all endpoints using **Postman**
- Committed code updates with clear structure

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Docker (for SQL database)
- Maven
- Postman (for testing)

## 📅 Day 4 – Spring Boot: Full CRUD with Layered Architecture

### ✅ What I Did
- Implemented **full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for the Notes API
- Followed **3-layer architecture**:
  - **Controller Layer** → Handles REST endpoints
  - **Service Layer** → Business logic + validations
  - **Repository Layer** → JPA-based DB access
- Added proper HTTP methods:
  - `POST /api/notes` → Create note
  - `GET /api/notes` → Get all notes
  - `GET /api/notes/{id}` → Get a single note
  - `PUT /api/notes/{id}` → Update note
  - `DELETE /api/notes/{id}` → Delete note
- Connected with local **Docker-based SQL database**
- Tested all endpoints via **Postman**
- Handled edge cases (e.g., updating a non-existent note)

### 🔍 Key Learning
> CRUD is the foundation of RESTful APIs. Building it using layered architecture improves scalability, testability, and maintainability.

---

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Add validations using `@Valid` + custom exception handling
- Connect with frontend (React) via API calls

## 📅 Day 5 – Spring Boot: Exception Handling & Validation

### ✅ What I Did
- Implemented **DTO-based validation** using `@Valid`, `@NotBlank`, and `@Size`
- Created a separate `NoteDTO` class for clean data transfer
- Added **custom exceptions** (`NoteNotFoundException`)
- Built a **global exception handler** using `@RestControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler`
- Returned user-friendly error responses for:
  - Validation failures
  - Resource not found
- Connected everything to the Notes REST API (continued from Day 4)
- Tested all scenarios using **Postman**

---

### 🧪 Technologies Used
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- Bean Validation (Jakarta)
- Docker (MySQL/Postgres)
- Postman

---

### 🔍 Key Concepts Learned
- DTO Pattern for API requests
- Bean validation with custom messages
- Handling `MethodArgumentNotValidException`
- Global error handling using `@ControllerAdvice`
- Clean separation of concerns (validation logic outside controller)

---

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Add custom validation logic (e.g., check for duplicates)
- Secure APIs using Spring Security
- Connect backend with frontend (React) via API calls

## 📅 Day 6 – Spring Boot: Logging & Basic Unit Testing

### ✅ What I Did
- Integrated **SLF4J logging** into the Notes API
  - Logged actions like fetching, creating, and deleting notes
- Created **basic unit tests** for `NoteService`
  - Tested note creation and fetching
- Ensured that the application structure remains clean and scalable

---

### 🧪 Technologies Used
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Web, Spring Data JPA
- SLF4J (logging)
- JUnit 5 (testing)
- Docker (for DB)

---

### 🔍 Key Concepts Learned
- Using `LoggerFactory` to log application events
- Writing unit tests for service layer
- Understanding test annotations like `@SpringBootTest` and `@WebMvcTest`
- Importance of test isolation and clean output in the console
- Implemented Service layer already but now added in here

---

### 💡 Logging Example
```java
private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(NoteController.class);
logger.info("Fetching all notes...");

# Spring Boot – Day 8

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. DTO (Data Transfer Object) Pattern
- Created dedicated DTO classes to decouple internal entities from API responses.
- Ensures that database models are not exposed directly to clients.
- Improves security, flexibility, and maintainability.

### 2. Custom API Response Structure
- Introduced a generic `ApiResponse<T>` wrapper for all API responses.
- Standardized the format of success and error messages.
- Makes it easier for frontend consumers to parse and handle responses.

### 3. Applied Clean Architecture Principles
- Maintained a clear separation between Controller, Service, and Repository layers.
- Kept DTOs and response models in dedicated packages for modularity.

## 🚀 Improvements
- Project now follows best practices for API response handling.
- Prepares the codebase for integration with frontend apps or external APIs.
